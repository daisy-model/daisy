;; Three ways to model PFAS input are examplified here: 
;; PFAS added as atomospheric deposition assumuing a decline in precipitation concentration
;; PFAS added with slurry using the subsurface irrigation function. Alternatively use the spray function, if PFAS contaminated organic fertilizer are applied on the surface.
;; PFAS added to field using PFAS contaminated effluent wastewater for irrigation
