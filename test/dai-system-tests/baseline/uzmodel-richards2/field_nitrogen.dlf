dlf-0.0 -- Field nitrogen (defined in 'log-std.dai').

VERSION: 7.0.0
LOGFILE: field_nitrogen.dlf
RUN: Fri Apr 12 11:44:42 2024

COLUMN: *
INTERVAL: box none

LOG: Nitrogen input, output, transformation and content for the system.
LOG: 
LOG: The intended use of this log is large scale nitrogen balance, for
LOG: example reservoir management. It provide information about how
LOG: much nitrogen is in the field (down to a specified depth), where
LOG: it is located in the field (surface, soil matrix or in biopores),
LOG: what form is has (crop, soil organic matter, or mineral) as well
LOG: as the sources, sinks and amounts of nitrogen entering or leaving
LOG: the system, and transformation between the four forms.  It does
LOG: not provide information about internal translocation of nitrogen
LOG: between surface, soil matrix and biopores, use see the 'Soil
LOG: nitrogen' log instead for that.
LOG: 
LOG: For the balances of this log to work, you must include the entire
LOG: root zone
