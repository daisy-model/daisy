dlf-0.0 -- Field water (defined in 'log-std.dai').

VERSION: 6.44
LOGFILE: field_water.dlf
RUN: Mon Jan 22 11:07:32 2024

COLUMN: *
INTERVAL: box none

LOG: Information about water input, output and content for the system.
LOG: 
LOG: The intended use of this log is large scale water balance, for
LOG: example reservoir management. It provide information about how
LOG: much water is in the field (down to a specified depth), where it
LOG: is located in the field (surface, soil matrix or in biopores), as
LOG: well as the sources, sinks and amounts of water entering or
LOG: leaving the system.  It does not provide information about
LOG: internal translocation of water between surface, soil matrix and
LOG: biopores, use see the 'Soil water' log instead for that.
LOG: 
LOG: For the balances of this log to work, you must include the entire
LOG: root zone, as well as the biopore zone.
