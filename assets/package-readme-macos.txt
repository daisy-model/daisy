To run Daisy, we suggest you install the TextMate 2.0 editor, and (afterwards) support files for running Daisy. The support files are available in /Applications/Daisy/TextMate after installation of Daisy.

To enable python support in Daisy you need to install python manually. The installer can be downloaded from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3132/ or directly from https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.13.2/python-3.13.2-macos11.pkg
