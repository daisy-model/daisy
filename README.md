# Daisy
Daisy is a mechanistic simulation of agricultural fields developed by the Agrohydrology group at the University of Copenhagen.

Daisy keeps track of water, nitrogen, carbon, and pesticides in the bioactive zone near the soil surface (roughly top of canopy to the bottom of the (historic) root zone).

* Optimize crop yields.
* Minimize nutrient losses.
* Avoid pesticide pollution.
* And much more!
