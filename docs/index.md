# Welcome to Daisy

Daisy is a mechanistic simulation of agricultural fields developed by the Agrohydrology group at the
University of Copenhagen.

Daisy keeps track of water, nitrogen, carbon, and pesticides in the bioactive zone near the soil
surface (roughly top of canopy to the bottom of the (historic) root zone).

## What can Daisy help you with?

- **Optimize crop yields** - Model different management strategies to maximize productivity
- **Minimize nutrient losses** - Reduce environmental impact while maintaining yields
- **Avoid pesticide pollution** - Understand pesticide fate and transport in agricultural systems
- **And much more!** - Comprehensive agricultural system modeling
